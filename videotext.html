				„With Scratch, you can make your own stories, games, and animations. Let's start by grabbing a Move Block. We can click the block to run it. There are many other blocks to choose from.
				Check out the different categories. Let's go to the Sound category and grab a Play Sound until Done Block. I'll snap this onto our Move Block. When do we want these code blocks to run?
				Add an Event Block on top to start the code. I'll add the When Green Flag Clicked block. You can easily reorder or delete these blocks at any time.
				Add as many characters as you want to your project and code each one. Check out the Tutorials page for ideas and inspiration.”
